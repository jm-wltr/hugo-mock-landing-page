# Understanding Radians 📐

Radians are a way to measure angles, just like degrees. They are widely used in mathematics, physics, and engineering because of their natural relationship with circles and trigonometric functions.

---

## What is a Radian? 🤔

A radian is the angle created when the length of an arc on a circle is equal to the radius of that circle.

### Key Facts:
- 1 radian is approximately **57.3 degrees**.
- A full circle has **2π radians**, which is equivalent to **360 degrees**.
- Half a circle (a straight angle) is **π radians** or **180 degrees**.

---

## Why Use Radians? 🧮

Radians simplify the relationship between an angle and the arc length of a circle. For example:
- The **arc length** is calculated as:
  - `Arc length = Radius × Angle in radians`

This makes radians the natural choice for mathematical calculations involving circles.

## Converting Between Degrees and Radians 🔄

### To convert degrees to radians:
Multiply the angle in degrees by `π/180`.

### To convert radians to degrees:
Multiply the angle in radians by `180/π`.

#### Examples:
1. Convert 90 degrees to radians:
   - `90 × π / 180 = π/2 radians`
   - Approximately 1.57 radians.

2. Convert π radians to degrees:
   - `π × 180 / π = 180 degrees`.

## How Radians Relate to the Unit Circle 🎯

In the unit circle:
- The radius is 1.
- The circumference is `2π`, so a full rotation equals `2π radians`.
- Some common angles and their radian measures:
  - 0 degrees = 0 radians
  - 90 degrees = `π/2` radians (about 1.57 radians)
  - 180 degrees = `π` radians (about 3.14 radians)
  - 270 degrees = `3π/2` radians (about 4.71 radians)
  - 360 degrees = `2π` radians (about 6.28 radians)

## Practice Problems 📝

### Problem 1:
Convert the following angles to radians:
1. 45 degrees
2. 120 degrees
3. 210 degrees

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Hint</strong></summary>
Multiply each angle by `π/180` to convert to radians. For example, `45 × π / 180`.

### Problem 2:
Convert the following radians to degrees:
1. `π/6`
2. `5π/4`
3. `2π`

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Hint</strong></summary>
Multiply each angle by `180/π` to convert to degrees. For example, `(π/6) × 180 / π`.

### Problem 3:
A wheel with a radius of 10 cm rolls 20 cm along a flat surface. What angle (in radians) does the wheel rotate through?

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Hint</strong></summary>
Use the formula `Angle in radians = Arc length / Radius`. In this case, the arc length is 20 cm and the radius is 10 cm.
